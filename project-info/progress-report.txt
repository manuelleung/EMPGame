This file contains the list of plans for the project
==================================================================

Manuel
==================================================================
1. Pathfinding -
	Character chosen will move to a selected destination

2. Camera -
	Implement the camera that will start from the player's position
	Camera must be free
	Move camera by using keyboard input

3. [DONE] Selection-box


4. Game World -
	Make a new Tile Map to replace placeholder
	Larger than the one used for testing
	Must have Collision layer and Grid layer

5. Hero Max Movement and Enemy Movement -
	Color in all tiles that a player can move to
	Max movement must be like a rombus with the player in the middle

6. Gameplay -
	Give hero and enemies attributes or base stats (such as health, attack damage, movement limit, etc)
	Add Turns (Player turn = 1, Enemy turn = 2)
	When turn = 1:
		Move - Select a tile with selector box and move to location (after move you can still choose to attack)
		Attack - Attack an only enemy if it is 1 tile away
		Wait - End turn (go to the next turn)
		Items - (Placeholder for now) or Add potion to increase health
	When turn = 2:
		Enemy AI can either choose to move or attack
		Move must always follow the player
		Attack always if the player is next to enemy
		(No need to add more AI for now)

7. Enemy -
	One type of enemy
	Get Sprite sheet for enemy
	Create enemies and spawn on random locations (preferably not close to the player)
