This file contains the list of plans for the project
==================================================================

IN-PROGRESS (from most to least important)

Enemy -
	One type of enemy
	Get Sprite sheet for enemy
	Create enemies and spawn on random locations (preferably not close to the player)
In-Game Player Menu -
	List of actions the player can perform (Move, Attack, Wait, Items)
Gameplay -
	Give hero and enemies attributes or base stats (such as health, attack damage, movement limit, etc)
	Add Turns (Player turn = 1, Enemy turn = 2)
	When turn = 1:
		Move - Select a tile with selector box and move to location (after move you can still choose to attack)
		Attack - Attack an only enemy if it is 1 tile away
		Wait - End turn (go to the next turn)
		Items - (Placeholder for now) or Add potion to increase health
	When turn = 2:
		Enemy AI can either choose to move or attack
		Move must always follow the player
		Attack always if the player is next to enemy
		(No need to add more AI for now)
Animation -
	Animate each corresponding action for player and enemy
Player Max Movement -
	Color in all tiles that a player can move to
	Max movement must be like a rombus with the player in the middle	
Pause -
	Pause the game when a keyboard key has been pressed
	Do not allow any actions to be done on the game	
Hero -
	Find a new spritesheet for hero to replace placeholder
	Make sure animation works correctly
